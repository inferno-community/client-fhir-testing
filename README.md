# client-fhir-testing
Tool to test a client's conformance with a FHIR implementation guide.


## Dev Setup:
The client fhir testing tool is in the form of a proxy application that 
will record transactions between a fhir client and a fhir server.  These 
transactions are recorded in a database where tests can be run against the 
HTTP requests to validate the client requests are valid. The requests 
can also be replayed to mimic client or server endpoints.  <br />

For development purposes we will use the Inferno tool to act as a FHIR 
client and a public endpoint will be used as a FHIR server.

### Install & Run Inferno (Client)
1.  Download & install inferno using Docker directions: <br />
https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno#installation-and-deployment

2.  Make sure docker desktop app is running

3.  `docker-compose up`

4.  open http://localhost:4567/


### Run Proxy
1.  Download this github repo <br />
`git clone https://github.com/inferno-community/client-fhir-testing.git`
`cd client-fhir-testing`

2.  Run proxy <br />
`FHIR_PROXY_BACKEND="https://r4.smarthealthit.org" rackup config.ru -p 9292 -o 0.0.0.0`
<br />
The shell environment variable FHIR_PROXY_BACKEND should be set to the 
FHIR server that the proxy will forward requests to.

### Run Inferno tests
We use inferno as our client but you can use any client/server interactions 
in this step. Note that the docker URL listed below resolves to the docker 
host machine on which the proxy is running.  Using localhost would refer 
to the docker instance and not the host itself.  <br />

1.  On the Inferno homepage, under "Start Testing", select "US Core v3.1.0", 
and put in the address of the proxy service <br />
`http://host.docker.internal:9292`

2.  Run tests, check the database for logged data.
